## Input

- An SRT subtitle file in any language

## Output

- A translated SRT file in Hong Kong Cantonese (Traditional Chinese)

## Workflow

Read the input SRT file and translate it following all rules in `references/zhhk-localization.md`.

Key rules:
- Traditional Chinese characters with Cantonese phrasing, not Mandarin phrasing
- Colloquial Hong Kong community language, preserve speaker tone
- All SRT block numbering and timestamps unchanged — translate only subtitle text
- Do not add comma (，) or full-stop (。) at the end of each subtitle line
- Keep people names in original language
- Game names and terms must use official HK/TW Traditional Chinese names or terms commonly used in HK gaming community
- Use Cantonese particles naturally: 啦, 囉, 嘅, 咩, 㗎, 喎, 噃, 嘛
- Specific slang mappings (see reference for full list):
  - "fucking" → 屌 (expression) / 撚 (between verb)
  - "oh shit" and similar → 屌 / 仆街
  - "Oh" → 哦
  - "Oh my god" → OMG

Save the output as `<original-name>-zhhk.srt` next to the input file, or to a user-specified path.
